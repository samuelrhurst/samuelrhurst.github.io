The [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) project was originally started in 2015 by Wes McKinney (the creator of pandas and a cofounder of Voltron Data), as a pandas-like interface to Apache Impala. In 2022, Phillip Cloud and the Ibis team he led at Voltron Data started dramatically expanding the scope of the project, building it into a 'universal python dataframe api', supporting a large variety of backends with a consistent dataframe interface. As of 2025, some notable backends it supports are BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Trino, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, MySQL, and Oracle. The coolest backend it supports is of course DuckDB, and the local combination of Ibis and DuckDB is likely to be very exciting for anyone with a use case that has outgrown pandas.
